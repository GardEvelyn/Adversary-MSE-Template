# MSE Adversary Template
These are the templates used for MSE-ADV cards, including a few variations that can be used such as Clear and DFC.

# Using the Templates
You will need Magic Set Editor to be able to use the templates, and you will need the M15 fonts that are included in the download. Double-click the .mse-installer file to install it to MSE. You should be able to either Double-click or Right-click > Install the fonts as you would with any other font file. *Cards that aren't using the fonts will not be considered for inclusion in a set, no exceptions.*

### Installing Fonts
Windows: Control Panel > Appearance and Personalisation > Fonts. Drag the fonts into there.  
Mac: Library > Fonts. Drag the fonts into there.  
*Easy peasy.*

### Energy
Energy counters are included in the template, but typing [E] doesn't work to make them. Attempts are being made to make that happen, but in the mean time the way to use the energy counters symbol is to type E for as many energy counters you want, then highlight them and press Ctrl+M. 

# Making an Adversary
There are quite vague rules when making an Adversary that makes things a little more complicated than trying to put the biggest numbers in and the strongest effects. Infinitely repeatable token generation effects (such as Bitterblossom, Thopter Spy Network, From Beyond) and discounts are generally frowned upon, as are life totals much higher than 20 and hand sizes that deviate well below or above 7. A case should be made for these sorts of cards. Just because there is a card in the set that already do it already isn't an excuse to do them.
